<p><strong>Day 09: Gorilla Tracking in Bwindi </strong></p>
<p>You will rise relatively early for a jovial breakfast to give you the energy needed for gorilla tracking.  Report to the ranger station at 08.00 am where the guides will take you through the forest, slashing at the undergrowth, to track gorillas. This trek can take from half an hour to five hours therefore, a reasonable degree of fitness is required as well as a sturdy pair of walking shoes. On top of that, there are other animals and birds which you could see on the way. You will spend only one hour with the gorillas as you listen, watch and marvel at them. It is amazing, for one to be in audience with these giants and think they would attack you. However, these gentle giants as they are known don’t attack anybody unless they are threatened, and sometimes, they tease you by jumping up and down and hitting their chests to scare you and see what your reaction would be. Under the circumstances, it is advisable not to look at them directly into their eyes, but look down and don’t show any jocular actions that may be interpreted as an attack to them, keep silence and talk in small tones.   And after one hour, they will leave you where you are or your guide will tell you when to depart. If you have the afternoon free, we could walk to the water fall nearby or you can take a guided village amongst the locals. Dinner and overnight as above.</p>
